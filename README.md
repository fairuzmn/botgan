Botgan
======

What the fuck is this?
----------------------

Botgan is a clear example of a simple chatbot that does little effort to simulate intelligent behaviour. The bot uses [Kaskus](http://kaskus.us/)' comments as "the source of knowledge" -- the language used is mainly Indonesian slang. This might sounds dumb, but common in the world of politics.

Always expect of the unexpected when you chat with Botgan. The bot's responses are, most of the time, incoherent or, sometime, offensive. It's guaranteed that you will be surprised, entertained or maybe amused as the bot responses are unpredictable.


How to run this thing?
----------------------

This version of Botgan should work on any OS that has Python and with [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) module installed.

From the command-line:

	$ python botgan.py
	> Hi apa kabar?
	pertamax aman gak nih ?? jah kduluan !! wkwkww
	> gak tau deh, emang penting ya?
	sundul lagi
